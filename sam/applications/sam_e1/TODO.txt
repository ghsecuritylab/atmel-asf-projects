== top prio ==

* make protocol compatible with tnt ICE40
** add 4-byte header to start of every USB transfer

* DFU loader support (from simtrace2)
* move microvty and logging over to CDC_ACM
* more LIU control
** RAW SPI read/write via USB CTRL REQ
** high-imptedance (external teermination) receiver

* proper transmit side support
** USB ISO OUT EP  -> SSC TX DMA
* code to generate CRC4 inside firmware (osmo_e1f.c)
* code to verify CRC4 inside firmwaer (osmo_e1f.c)

== medium prio ==

* more complete frame alignment inside firmware (osmo_e1f.c)
* Isochronous feedback endpoint for TX (OUT EP) side
** USB driver in kernel should automatically take care of throttling
* LIU register dump via serial console
* LIU control via serial console
** long/short haul
** transmitter enable/disable
** generate PRBS in transmitter (MAINT0)
** read line attenuation
* LIU interrupt handling
** add pull-up or switch IRQ output to push-pull/active-low (GCF register)
** report status via IRQ endpoint

== low prio ==

* switch from CDC-ACM for "usb-serial-simple.c" to save one endpoint
* add code to connect usb-serial to UART (for GPS module)
* DAC related code for VC[TC]XO
