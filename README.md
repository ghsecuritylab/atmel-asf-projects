Osmocom firmware projects based on Atmel ASF
============================================

This repository contains [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org) device firmware
projects for Atmel microcontrollers using
[Atmel ASF](http://www.microchip.com/webdoc/asf/pr01.html)

Unfortuantely Atmel is not able to provide ASF under revision control,
so we will have to manually check in the releases they make into this
git repository.

Below is a list of Osmocom device firmware that is built in this repo:


sam_e1

This is an experimental project about building an E1 adapter using
a SAM4S processor.  You can find its source code in sam/applications/sam_e1
