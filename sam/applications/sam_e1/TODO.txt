== top prio ==

* USB ISO OUT EP  -> SSC TX DMA
* USB ISO IN EP <- SSC RX DMA
* code to do frame alignment inside firmware (osmo_e1f.c)
** adjusting TC register to do frame alignment
*** maybe even extend RC from 256 to 16*256=16384 to get full alignment using TC?
* code to generate CRC4 inside firmware (osmo_e1f.c)
* code to verify CRC4 inside firmwaer (osmo_e1f.c)

== medium prio ==

* Isochronous feedback endpoint for TX (OUT EP) side
** USB driver in kernel should automatically take care of throttling
* LIU register dump via serial console
* LIU control via serial console
** long/short haul
** transmitter enable/disable
** high-imptedance (external teermination) receiver
** generate PRBS in transmitter (MAINT0)
** read line attenuation
* LIU interrupt handling
** add pull-up or switch IRQ output to push-pull/active-low (GCF register)
** report status at the end of USB IN to host + print to console

== low prio ==

* switch from CDC-ACM for "usb-serial-simple.c" to save one endpoint
* add code to connect usb-serial to UART (for GPS module)
* DAC related code for VC[TC]XO
